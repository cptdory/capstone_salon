        The Founder, David Charlton
    </h3>
    <div class="about-founder">
        <div class="founder-left-block">
            <div class="second about-text-block">
                David Charlton was born in Suderland, in Tyme and Wear, England, and was exposed to
                hairdressing at a very early age. Charlton came from a family of hairdressers-one of 
                the most sought-after careers in England. At 16, he was working full-time at his uncle’s 
                salon while studying at the Durham Technical College. After 3 years of studying, 
                Charlton passed with distinction the City and Guilds of London Institute Examination 
                in Men’s and Ladies’ Hairdressing. This distinction opened the opportunity for Charlton 
                to go back to Tyne and Wear, tihis time in south Shields, to teach hairdressing. He 
                also conducted workshops for the North East Hairdressers’ Federation.
                <br><br>
                It was in 1978 when Charlton came came to the Philippines. He was the manager of Rever 
                Salon at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and after becoming a partner and later on its 
                sole owner, Charlton expanded the Rever Salon to five locations. In 1989, after seeing
                a need for a salon that would offer high quality hairdressing at a customer-friendly 
                price, Charlton established David’s Salon Inc. With the desire to share his expertise 
                to more Filipinos, he opened the very first David’s Salon in New Farmer’s Market in 
                Cubao, Quezon City.
                <br><br>
                A realization of a need that has opened many opportunities, David’s Salon not just 
                shared a unique style to many Filipinos, but likewise opened employment and skill
                acquisition opportunities for many promising Filipino stylists. Now the largest chain
                    of salons in the Philippines, David’s Salon has 200 branches, and counting. Salons
                are present in key locations in the Greater Manila Area as well as in the provinces.
                In 2008, the first US branch of David’s Salon opened in Los Angeles, California, 
                and in February 2010, the first David’s Salon branch in the Middle East opened in Dubai.
